# AthenaDB 🌐

Welcome to AthenaDB, an open-source initiative aimed at revolutionizing how we interact with large datasets using the power of artificial intelligence. Named after the Greek goddess of wisdom 🦉, AthenaDB embodies intelligence, strategic warfare, and diplomacy, reflecting the project's core principles: smart data segmentation, strategic querying, and seamless integration.

## Overview 📜

AthenaDB is designed to tackle the challenges posed by the token limitations of GPT models in handling extensive datasets. By breaking down data into manageable 'chunks,' AthenaDB facilitates more efficient storage, retrieval, and summarization of information. It leverages the prowess of GPT-powered question assigners to intelligently navigate and utilize data, regardless of scale.

Our goal is to create an API-driven environment where developers can store data in segmented blocks, each corresponding to a GPT model's token capacity. This segmentation allows for an expansion of tokens available to queries, thus circumventing the token limitations that typically constrain such AI models.

## Features ✨

- **Data Segmentation**: Efficiently stores data in chunks, each paired with a GPT model to optimize token usage.
- **Dynamic Summarization**: Automatically updates data summaries in chunks, ensuring that the system remains up-to-date with the latest information 🔍.
- **Scalable Querying**: Utilizes a hierarchical system of question assigners to manage and retrieve data, scaling to accommodate an ever-growing dataset 📈.
- **Vectorized Caching**: Implements a vectorized caching system to enhance response times by referencing past queries with high similarity 💨.
- **Token Tracking**: Includes a 'tokens' column for DataChunks and Data tables to monitor and manage token allocation effectively 📊.

## Philosophy 🤔

AthenaDB isn't just a database; it's a testament to the potential of AI systems to grow alongside the data they handle. With a vision for effortless scaling and a user-friendly interface, AthenaDB aspires to make complex data interactions simple and accessible.

We invite you to join us on this journey to not just build a database, but to forge a community where developers, innovators, and thinkers converge to create something truly transformative 💪.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute to the birth of a new era in data interaction.
